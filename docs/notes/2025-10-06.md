**Goal:** Create a visually arresting GitHub profile banner

## October 6, 2025

### Initial SVG Exploration
- Started with basic SVG triangle generation
- Created `triangle-fill.svg` with equilateral triangle tessellation
  - 232+ triangles filling a 400x400 square
  - Side length: 40px, height: ~34.64px
  - Alternating coral (#FF6B6B) and turquoise (#4ECDC4) colors
  - White stroke borders (0.5px)

### Animation Experiments
- Added SVG `<animate>` elements to create pulsing stroke-width effect
- Built `add_animation.js` (Node.js) - initial script to inject animation tags into polygon elements
  - Pattern matching for self-closing polygon tags
  - Replaced with opening tags + `<animate>` elements + closing tags
- Created `update_animation.js` (Node.js) - improved version that can:
  - Update existing animations (not just add new ones)
  - Configure animation parameters: values, duration
  - Handle both self-closing and already-animated polygons
  
**Animation Parameters Explored:**
- `values="0.5;2;0.5"` → `values="0.5;6;0.5"` (more dramatic pulse)
- `dur="2s"` → `dur="1s"` (faster animation)

### Edge-Case Fixes
- Discovered gaps on left edge of square
- Manually added triangles extending to x=-20 on even rows (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
- Fixed color alternation pattern for edge triangles

### Project Evolution Decision
- Decided to build a web UI for interactive SVG parameter control
- Merged React template (`my-stack`) into repo
  - React + Vite + Styled Components stack
  - Resolved README.md merge conflict
  - Template provides foundation for interactive controls

### Tools Created (May Not Survive)
- `add_animation.js` - first iteration, only works on fresh polygons
- `update_animation.js` - successor, handles updates to existing animations
- Both served as quick iteration tools before building proper UI

### Next Steps
- Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- Build React component to render SVG
- Create UI controls for:
  - Fill colors
  - Stroke color
  - Stroke width (static + animated values)
  - Animation duration
  - Triangle size/count
- Consider: single banner vs. generator tool for others?

## Notes & Learnings
- SVG `<animate>` is powerful for simple animations without JavaScript
- `repeatCount="indefinite"` creates continuous loops
- Equilateral triangle tessellation requires careful math for seamless filling
- Git remotes can be temporary - useful for one-time template merges
- Scripts as throwaway tools vs. permanent infrastructure

## Questions to Explore
- Should this be a personal banner or a tool for everyone?
- How to balance visual impact with load time (232+ triangles)?
- Can we add interactivity beyond animation (click, hover effects)?
- Export options: SVG, PNG, animated GIF?
