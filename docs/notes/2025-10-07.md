Unfortunately one of my favorite svgs is an absolute battery killer. It used over 1GB of RAM in a chrome tab. Running just two instances of it brought my MacBook Pro to its melting point and killed battery faster than my little 30W charger could handle. And it didn't even render correctly on mobile. But what does render correctly is CSS! I thought it was disabled/sanitized by Github, but apparently not. This will help performance and add functionality too. Apprently SMIL is not supported as well as CSS/JS for animation on the web.
